## surf up
 Setting up a surf and ice cream shop. We're partnering with W.Avy and he wants more information about the weather before committing on opening this shop on the island of Oahu. We will make an analyst over the course of previous year of the temperature of the months of December and June.
 
## Results

-In June has a count of 1700, mean of 74.94, standard deviation 3.25, Minimum 64, Maximum of 85 

- In December has a count of 1517, mean 71, Standard deviation is 3.7, minimum of 56 and a maximum of 83

## Summary 
From My gathering and analyzing the data, looking at the year around temperature and the rain. In my analyst December is a little bit chillier than the month of June. For more information to reach a decisive conclusion, we would need to run more queries to take more inconsideration on the rain, also we would need more information about the community and visitors all year round to make if this would be the right spot for a surf shop.
